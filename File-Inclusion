# File Inclusion
This room focuses on file inclusion vulnerabilities such as Local File Inclusion, Remote File Inclusion, and directory traversal. Wikipedia says its a vulnerability found in web application run times. One of the issues is input validation, meaning that users have unwarranted access
to inputs. If it is not validated, users can exploit this and access unintended items, such as data and credentials. The attacker can also write these files and gain remote command execution.


# Path/Directory Traversal
A web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to read OS resources. By using the web application's URL, if it is not verified, can be easily accessed if not directly in the root directory of the application.
